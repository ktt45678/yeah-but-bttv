# Yeah but BTTV
It's like a third party thing, i don't know.

A simple Youtube chat injection thingamagic so you can use BTTV/FFZ/7TV emotes and show it on your Youtube chat.

## Usage

1. Download Node
2. Clone this repository
3. Install all the packages with `npm install`
4. Run the program with `node .`

It should open a localhost server at port 7776.
After that you can just use this link: `http://localhost:7776/yeah-but-bttv/your_youtube_channel_id_here`

Or you can use the deployed version that I host on Heroku: `https://naotimes-og.glitch.me/yeah-but-bttv/your_youtube_channel_id_here`
